# Abstract

This report documents the design and development of a web-based project management and business intelligence system, built during a three-month internship at Creative Media, a small graphic design agency in Tunisia. The agency currently has no digital system for tracking project hours or measuring profitability - costs are estimated informally, and it is only after a project closes that the manager can judge whether it was financially sound.

The system developed here addresses this directly. It provides a Django REST API backend, a React/TypeScript single-page application for the frontend, and a PostgreSQL database. Three user roles are supported: a Manager who oversees all projects and accesses analytical dashboards, Designers who log time against tasks, and Clients who submit feedback and track their project status.

Key metrics implemented include the Effective Hourly Rate, Budget Utilisation, Scope Creep Index, Designer Utilisation, and Revision-to-Approval Ratio. All are computed in real time via PostgreSQL aggregate queries. The system also supports file uploads, an internal messaging board per project, and PDF/Excel export of reports.

Development was organised as six two-week Agile sprints. Chapter 3 documents the full requirements specification and global system design. Chapters 4 through 9 cover the implementation, testing, and outcomes of each sprint.

Future development may extend the system to a multi-tenant architecture, enabling independent design agencies to operate on a shared platform with fully isolated data environments.

# Résumé

Ce rapport documente la conception et le développement d'un système web de gestion de projets et d'intelligence d'affaires, réalisé lors d'un stage de trois mois chez Creative Media, une petite agence de design graphique en Tunisie. L'agence ne dispose actuellement d'aucun système numérique pour le suivi des heures de projet ou la mesure de la rentabilité - les coûts sont estimés de manière informelle, et ce n'est qu'à la clôture d'un projet que le responsable peut évaluer sa viabilité financière.

Le système développé répond directement à cette problématique. Il repose sur une API REST Django en backend, une application monopage React/TypeScript en frontend, et une base de données PostgreSQL. Trois rôles utilisateurs sont pris en charge : un Responsable supervisant l'ensemble des projets et accédant aux tableaux de bord analytiques, des Designers saisissant leurs heures sur les tâches, et des Clients soumettant des retours et suivant l'avancement de leurs projets.

Les indicateurs clés implémentés comprennent le Taux Horaire Effectif, le Taux d'Utilisation du Budget, l'Indice de Dérive du Périmètre, le Taux d'Utilisation des Designers et le Ratio Révisions/Validation. Tous sont calculés en temps réel via des requêtes d'agrégation PostgreSQL. Le système prend également en charge l'envoi de fichiers, un tableau de messagerie interne par projet, ainsi que l'export des rapports en PDF et Excel.

Le développement a été organisé en six sprints Agiles de deux semaines chacun. Le chapitre 3 documente l'intégralité des spécifications des besoins et de la conception globale du système. Les chapitres 4 à 9 couvrent la mise en œuvre, les tests et les résultats de chaque sprint.

Les perspectives futures envisagent une extension vers une architecture multi-tenant, permettant à plusieurs agences indépendantes d'opérer sur une plateforme commune avec des environnements de données entièrement cloisonnés.

# General Introduction

## 1\. Context and Justification

Graphic design agencies operate in a highly competitive environment where the quality of creative output must be balanced against strict budget and deadline constraints. Unlike product-based businesses, design agencies generate their entire revenue by selling designer time - yet most agencies have no system to track how that time is spent relative to what was budgeted. Project tracking, if done at all, relies on spreadsheets, verbal agreements, or generic task management tools that lack financial visibility.

The consequences of this gap are significant. Without real-time data on hours logged against a project budget, a manager cannot know whether a project is profitable until it is complete - often too late to take corrective action. Scope creep, defined as the accumulation of tasks added after a project's initial specification, is particularly damaging in creative work, where revision cycles are frequent and the boundary between contracted and extra work is easily blurred.

Creative Media, the host organisation for this internship, faces precisely these challenges. Projects are currently tracked informally, profitability is estimated rather than measured, and designer capacity is managed by intuition rather than data. This project was initiated to address these gaps directly.

## 2\. Problem Statement and Objectives

The central research question guiding this project is: How can a graphic design agency gain real-time, data-driven visibility into the profitability of its projects, the utilisation of its designers, and the extent of unplanned scope growth - and use that information to make better operational and financial decisions?

To answer this question, the following objectives were defined:

- Design and develop a full-stack web application covering the complete project lifecycle, from creation to delivery.
- Implement a granular time-tracking system linking logged hours to specific tasks and project budgets.
- Build analytical dashboards exposing key profitability metrics: Effective Hourly Rate, Budget Utilisation, Scope Creep Index, Designer Utilisation, and Revision-to-Approval Ratio.
- Enforce role-based access control for three user types (Manager, Designer, Client) ensuring data confidentiality and appropriate functionality per role.
- Support PDF and Excel report exports for offline management reporting.
- Deploy the complete system to a cloud environment accessible by the agency's team.

## 3\. Methodology

This project adopts an Agile development methodology adapted for a solo developer context, organised into six two-week sprints, each delivering a vertical slice of working functionality - from the database layer through the API to the user interface. This approach produces demonstrable progress at each supervisor review and limits integration risk by ensuring every feature is complete before the next is started.

## 4\. Report Structure

The subsequent chapters follow the six-sprint development cycle, each presenting the backlog, design, implementation, and testing outcomes for that iteration, preceded by the host organisation context and theoretical framework in Chapters 1 and 2. The General Conclusion synthesises the results and proposes future perspectives.

### 1.4 Internship Context and Tasks Performed

The student was placed at Creative Media to design and develop an internal project management and analytics system - a tool the agency currently lacks entirely. The internship tasks are directly aligned with the software engineering and BI activities documented in this report, and include:

- Requirements elicitation: structured discussions with the professional supervisor to identify operational pain points, define user roles, and establish system scope.
- UML modelling: development of use case diagrams, class diagrams, and sequence diagrams to formalise system requirements.
- System architecture and data model design: three-tier architecture definition and full entity-relationship design.
- Backend and frontend development (Sprints 1-6): progressive full-stack implementation covering all Django models, JWT authentication, user onboarding, project and task management, time tracking, client feedback, BI dashboards, file management, PDF/Excel report exports, and cloud deployment on Render.
- Iterative review: regular progress presentations to the professional supervisor with incorporation of feedback into subsequent development cycles.

## 2\. Project Context and Problem Statement

### 2.1 The Problem Being Solved

The fundamental problem this system addresses is the absence of financial transparency in creative project management. At Creative Media, when a project concludes, it is often unclear whether it was profitable. A project invoiced at a fixed price may have required significantly more designer hours than estimated, eroding or eliminating the margin. This occurs for two primary reasons:

- Scope creep: clients frequently request revisions or additional elements after the project specification has been agreed upon. Without a formal tracking mechanism, these additions are absorbed into the workload without being reflected in the invoice.
- No real-time budget visibility: because hours are not logged systematically against budgets, the manager cannot intervene when a project is trending over budget before it is too late.

Secondary problems include the inability to identify which clients generate the most revision cycles and are therefore least profitable, and the difficulty of planning designer capacity when utilisation data is unavailable.

### 2.2 Scope Boundaries

The system covers the complete project lifecycle for Managers, Designers, and Clients, including a BI analytics layer and Render cloud deployment. Invoicing, payroll, real-time collaborative editing, and third-party design-tool integrations are out of scope.

## 3\. Development Methodology

### 3.1 Classical vs. Agile Approaches - Comparative Overview

Two broad methodological families exist for software development projects: classical (sequential/waterfall) approaches and Agile iterative approaches. Table 3 summarises the key differences.

| **Criterion**           | **Classical (Waterfall)**       | **Agile (Scrum)**             |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Requirements**        | Fixed upfront                   | Evolve iteratively            |
| **Delivery**            | Single release at end           | Working increment each sprint |
| **Feedback**            | End of project                  | After every sprint            |
| **Risk** **Management** | Late defect discovery           | Early detection per cycle     |
| **Documentation**       | Extensive upfront               | Lean, just-in-time            |
| **Adaptation**          | Costly - requires phase restart | Built into sprint cycle       |

Table 3: Classical vs. Agile: Comparative Overview

### 3.2 Justification for the Chosen Methodology

Agile was selected for three reasons specific to the internship context. First, requirements at Creative Media were partially discovered - the manager knew the pain points but not the precise metrics or workflows that would address them, making iterative elicitation preferable to a complete upfront specification. Second, the twelve-week constraint demanded working software at every milestone for supervisor review; a waterfall approach would have produced nothing demonstrable for the first eight weeks. Third, as a solo developer, the cost of context-switching between large phases (all models, then all APIs, then all UI) is high; vertical slices within each sprint keep cognitive load manageable.

### 3.3 Agile Sprint-Based Approach

The project adopts the Scrum framework, which organises development into fixed-length iterations called sprints, each producing a usable software increment. While Scrum is designed for teams, its core mechanics - sprint planning, backlog management, and retrospective review - adapt naturally to a supervised solo project. Six two-week sprints structure the work, each with a clearly defined goal and deliverable. This produces working, demonstrable software at the end of every sprint - enabling regular supervisor review - and limits the scope of each development cycle, reducing the risk of losing context across a large codebase.

Figure 3: Agile Sprint Cycle

### 3.4 Vertical Slice Development

Within each sprint, features are developed as vertical slices: each user story is implemented end-to-end - database model → serialiser → API view → React component - before the next story begins. This contrasts with a horizontal approach where all models come first, then all APIs, then all UI; the horizontal approach produces nothing testable for extended periods and makes early requirement validation impossible.

Figure 4: Per-Sprint Development Workflow

### 3.5 Modelling Languages and Tools

This report uses the Unified Modelling Language (UML) for all structural and behavioural diagrams. UML was chosen because it is the standard notation for object-oriented software design and provides a shared vocabulary between the academic context and professional practice. The following UML diagram types are used throughout the report: Use Case Diagrams (system scope and actor interactions), Class Diagrams (static domain model), Sequence Diagrams (dynamic interaction flows), and Deployment Diagrams (physical infrastructure topology). All UML diagrams were produced using draw.io.

## 4\. Chapter Conclusion

Creative Media's absence of digital project tracking defines a well-bounded business problem, and the Agile sprint methodology provides the structure needed to deliver a full-stack solution within twelve weeks. Chapter 2 establishes the theoretical and technical framework that grounds the design decisions made throughout implementation.

# Chapter 2 - Literature Review and Technical Framework

## 1\. Introduction

This chapter reviews BI practice in service industries, evaluates existing tools, justifies the technology stack, and states the working hypotheses evaluated in the General Conclusion.

## 2\. Business Intelligence in Service Industries

### 2.1 Definition and Role of Business Intelligence

Business Intelligence (BI) refers to the set of technologies, processes, and practices that transform raw operational data into meaningful, actionable information for decision-makers. In a service industry context - where revenue is generated by selling time and expertise rather than tangible goods - BI plays a particularly important role in understanding the relationship between inputs (designer hours) and outputs (project value delivered to clients).

A key distinction in BI is between operational reporting, which describes what happened, and analytical intelligence, which explains why it happened and enables prediction. This system implements both: operational views (time logs per project, feedback per task) and analytical metrics (EHR, budget variance, scope creep index) that provide explanatory power for management decisions.

### 2.2 Key Performance Indicators for Creative Agencies

Selecting the right KPIs is critical: too few and management lacks visibility; too many and decision-making is paralysed by noise. Based on industry practice and the specific pain points identified at Creative Media, six metrics were selected as the core analytical layer of this system. The Effective Hourly Rate is the central profitability indicator: it expresses how much monetary value the agency generates per designer hour logged. A high EHR indicates an efficiently managed project; a low EHR indicates underpricing or overconsumption of hours. The Scope Creep Index complements this by revealing whether a low EHR is driven by poor estimation or uncontrolled scope expansion.

| **Metric**                      | **Formula**                                             | **Business Meaning**                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Effective Hourly Rate (EHR)** | budget_amount ÷ SUM(hours_spent)                        | Revenue earned per hour of designer time invested                    |
| **Budget Utilisation %**        | SUM(hours_spent) ÷ budget_hours × 100                   | Proportion of the allocated hour budget consumed to date             |
| **Estimation Variance %**       | (SUM(actual) − SUM(estimated)) ÷ SUM(estimated) × 100   | Accuracy of the original task hour estimates                         |
| **Scope Creep Index**           | COUNT(is_unplanned=True) ÷ COUNT(\*) × 100              | Percentage of tasks added after project kick-off                     |
| **Designer Utilisation %**      | SUM(hours this week) ÷ available_hours_per_week × 100   | Proportion of contracted capacity actually billed                    |
| **Revision-to-Approval Ratio**  | COUNT(category='Revision') ÷ COUNT(category='Approval') | Client feedback quality; high values signal rework-intensive clients |

Table 4: Analytical Metrics Implemented in the System

## 3\. Project Management Information Systems

### 3.1 Characteristics of an Effective PMIS

A Project Management Information System (PMIS) is a software system that supports the planning, execution, monitoring, and control of projects. For a creative agency, an effective PMIS must balance the structured task tracking of traditional project management with the flexibility required in creative workflows, where scope is often iterative and client-driven.

Key characteristics of an effective PMIS in this context include: role-differentiated access (so that clients see only their own projects, designers see only their assignments, and managers have complete visibility); real-time status updates (task status, hours logged against budget); and direct integration between task management and financial tracking (so that logged hours translate immediately into budget consumption data without manual consolidation).

### 3.2 Analysis of Existing Tools

Several commercial tools address parts of the problem this system solves. A comparative analysis justifies the decision to build a bespoke solution rather than adopt an off-the-shelf product.

| **Tool**            | **Strengths**                                        | **Gaps for Creative Media**                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Harvest**         | Strong time tracking and invoicing; team reporting   | No custom scope creep tracking; requires integration with separate PM tools; no client profitability analytics |
| **Toggl** **Track** | Excellent timer-based tracking; good team dashboards | No project budget management; no client-facing portal; no BI metrics                                           |
| **FunctionFox**     | Designed for creative agencies; project costing      | Proprietary SaaS with per-seat pricing; no customisable analytical layer; cannot adapt KPIs to agency needs    |
| **Monday.com**      | Powerful general-purpose PM; highly configurable     | No financial analytics; no EHR or scope creep concept; requires significant setup for basic time tracking      |
| **Asana**           | Mature task management; good workflow automation     | No time tracking or budget tracking natively; no analytical layer; no client portal                            |

Table 5: Comparison of Existing Project Management Tools

The gap common to all these tools is the absence of customisable, agency-specific profitability analytics integrated directly into the project management workflow. None expose a Scope Creep Index, an EHR per client, or a client profitability ranking weighted by revision frequency - the three metrics most relevant to Creative Media's decision-making.

## 4\. Technical Framework and Technology Justification

### 4.1 System Architecture Pattern

The system follows a three-tier client-server architecture: a React single-page application communicates exclusively with a Django REST API via JSON over HTTPS; the API communicates with a PostgreSQL database. This separation provides several advantages: the frontend and backend can be developed, tested, and deployed independently; the API can be consumed by future clients (mobile apps, integrations) without changes; and authentication and authorisation logic is enforced centrally at the API boundary rather than on the client side, preventing data leakage through URL manipulation.

Figure 5: Three-Tier System Architecture

### 4.2 Technology Stack Justification

| **Layer**             | **Technology**        | **Justification**                                                                                                                                                   |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend**           | Django 5 + DRF 3.15   | Mature Python framework. ORM enables complex multi-table aggregate queries. DRF provides battle-tested serialisation and viewset patterns with minimal boilerplate. |
| **Authentication**    | Simple JWT library    | Stateless JWT tokens. No server-side session storage. Role embedded in payload enables role-based routing without secondary API call.                               |
| **Database**          | PostgreSQL 16         | Advanced aggregation capabilities (window functions, conditional COUNT, multi-level joins) required for the BI layer. ACID compliance critical for financial data.  |
| **Frontend**          | React 18 + TypeScript | Component-based SPA. TypeScript enforces consistency between API data shapes and component props, catching integration errors at compile time.                      |
| **Build** **tool**    | Vite                  | Fast dev server with HMR. Significantly faster than CRA for TypeScript projects; production build is optimised and small.                                           |
| **Data** **fetching** | TanStack React Query  | Declarative server-state management with automatic cache invalidation on mutation - eliminates significant boilerplate vs. plain Redux.                             |
| **Styling**           | Tailwind CSS          | Utility-first CSS with consistent design tokens. Avoids style conflicts in component-heavy UIs.                                                                     |
| **Charts**            | Recharts              | React-native charting library built on D3. Declarative and composable - well-suited for BI dashboards with dynamic data.                                            |
| **Forms**             | React Hook Form + Zod | Performant uncontrolled forms with schema-based validation. Zod schemas mirror backend serialiser validation.                                                       |
| **AI Inference**      | Groq API              | Provides low-latency hosted LLM inference. The llama-3.3-70b-versatile model offers strong contextual reasoning.                                                    |
| **PDF** **export**    | ReportLab             | Standard Python library for programmatic PDF generation, widely used in Django projects.                                                                            |
| **Excel** **export**  | openpyxl              | Python library for .xlsx generation with formatting and multi-sheet support.                                                                                        |
| **Deployment**        | Render                | Managed Web Service + Static Site + PostgreSQL. Simple environment variable management and automatic deploys from Git.                                              |

Table 6: Technology Stack with Justifications

### 4.3 Authentication Strategy

The system uses JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication implemented via the Simple JWT library. JWTs are stateless: the server does not maintain a session store, and authorisation decisions are made by decoding the token on each request. The payload includes the user's ID, email, and role, enabling role-based filtering without an additional database query per request.

A short-lived access token (60 minutes) paired with a longer-lived refresh token (7 days) is used. The React frontend's Axios interceptor automatically detects 401 responses, requests a new access token using the refresh token, and retries the failed request - making token expiry invisible to the user in normal usage.

New user onboarding uses a separate invitation token mechanism: a UUID token with a 48-hour expiry is generated and emailed to new users by the Manager. Users must activate their account by setting a password through this token before JWT login becomes available. This prevents self-registration and ensures only Manager-approved users access the system.

## 5\. Synthesis and Working Hypotheses

The literature review and comparative analysis confirm that the system being built fills a genuine gap in available tooling for small-to-medium creative agencies. The following working hypotheses guide the design and implementation. Each is evaluated against the completed system in the General Conclusion.

**H1:** Systematic time logging against project tasks, when integrated with budget data, will enable managers to identify unprofitable projects in real time rather than retrospectively.

**H2:** A formal Scope Creep Index will make the volume and frequency of unplanned work visible, enabling the agency to adjust contract terms or pricing models for repeat clients.

**H3:** Role-scoped access will ensure that client-facing views do not expose sensitive financial data (EHR, profitability rankings) while still providing clients with meaningful project status visibility.

**H4:** Server-side computation of all metrics via PostgreSQL aggregations will ensure dashboards reflect live data without requiring a separate data warehouse or ETL process.

## 6\. Chapter Conclusion

No existing tool combines role-scoped project management, designer time logging, structured client feedback, and customisable agency-specific profitability analytics in a single platform - confirming the need for a bespoke solution. The technology stack selected provides the capabilities required to build both the operational management layer and the analytical layer within the project constraint. Chapter 3 translates this into concrete requirements and a global system design.

# Chapter 3 - Sprint 0: Requirements Specification and System Design

## 1\. Introduction

This chapter documents Sprint 0 in full. It begins with a structured requirements capture, then presents the Scrum planning artefacts (product backlog, use case diagrams, Gantt chart), the interface wireframes, the hardware and software development environment, the system architecture, and the global data model.

## 2\. Requirements Capture

### 2.1 Identification of Actors

Functional requirements were elicited through structured discussions with the professional supervisor and organised by user role. The system defines four actors: three internal users interacting directly with the platform, and one external technical actor.

| **Actor**        | **Type**             | **Role Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Manager**      | Internal             | The primary platform administrator. Creates and manages user accounts, projects, tasks, and designers. Has full visibility of all projects, analytics dashboards, and profitability reports. The only role authorised to generate and export PDF/Excel reports.                    |
| **Designer**     | Internal             | A team member assigned to one or more projects by the Manager. Views only their assigned projects and tasks, logs time against tasks, updates task status, uploads deliverable files, and views and responds to client feedback.                                                   |
| **Client**       | External             | A customer of the agency who is associated with one or more projects. Authenticated access limited to their own projects. Views project status, uploads reference materials and brand guidelines, submits feedback on deliverables, and participates in the project message board. |
| **Email System** | External (Technical) | An external actor representing the SMTP or transactional email service. Triggered automatically by the system when a Manager creates a new user account. Responsible for delivering invitation emails containing secure, time-limited password-creation links.                     |

## 6\. System Architecture

### 6.1 Physical Architecture

The system is deployed on Render across three components: a Static Site serving the compiled React SPA (CDN-backed), a Web Service running the Django REST API (containerised), and a managed PostgreSQL instance isolated from the application tier. All communication between the SPA and the API occurs over HTTPS; the API communicates with the database over a private internal network not exposed to the public internet.

### 6.2 Logical / Software Architecture

The Django backend is organised into eight domain apps: users, projects, tasks, timelog, feedback, messages, files, and analytics. The analytics app is architecturally distinct - it contains no models, only views executing aggregate queries across the other apps. This clean separation between the operational data layer and the analytical computation layer is a deliberate design decision that prevents analytics logic from contaminating domain models.

Figure 11: Backend Directory Structure

The React frontend mirrors this structure with separate api/, hooks/, types/, pages/, and components/ directories. Each resource has its own typed API functions, React Query hooks, and TypeScript interfaces, ensuring that the type contract between backend and frontend is maintained explicitly.

Figure 12: Frontend Directory Structure

### 6.3 Architecture Rationale

The choice of a strict three-tier separation with all business logic in the API layer (rather than partly in the frontend) is a security decision as much as a structural one. By enforcing RBAC at the API boundary - via both permission classes and query-level filtering - the system ensures that a client who manipulates URL parameters or intercepts API responses cannot access other clients' data. The frontend's role is presentation only.

### 6.4 Deployment Diagram

Figure 13: Deployment Diagram

## 7\. Global Data Model

### 7.1 Global Class Diagram

The class diagram models all eleven domain objects and their relationships. The central entity is Project, which aggregates Tasks (with optional subtask nesting via a self-referential foreign key), time-logged by Designers through TimeLogs, and feedback submitted by Clients. The User entity drives authentication; role-differentiated profiles (Designer and Client) are attached via one-to-one relationships.

### 7.2 Entity-Relationship Diagram

The ERD presents the physical database schema derived from the class diagram. Key constraints are visible: the deletion-protected link from Project to Client, the compound uniqueness constraint on ProjectAssignment, and the self-referential foreign key on Task.

Figure 15: Entity-Relationship Diagram

### 7.3 Relational Schema

The relational schema below presents all eleven entities with their attributes. Foreign keys are denoted with the # symbol.

**User** (user_id, email, full_name, password, role, is_active, is_staff, created_at).

**Designer** (designer_id, #user_id, hourly_rate, specialization, available_hours_per_week).

**Client** (client_id, #user_id, phone, industry).

**InvitationToken** (token_id, #user_id, token, expires_at, is_used).

**Project** (project_id, #client_id, project_name, description, budget_hours, budget_amount, deadline, status, category, created_at, updated_at).

**ProjectAssignment** (assignment_id, #project_id, #designer_id, assigned_at).

**Task** (task_id, #project_id, #parent_task_id, task_name, description, estimated_hours, status, is_unplanned, created_at).

**TimeLog** (log_id, #task_id, #designer_id, hours_spent, description, created_at).

**Feedback** (feedback_id, #project_id, category, content_text, status, submitted_at, resolved_at).

**Message** (message_id, #project_id, #sender_id, content_text, is_read, created_at).

**FileUpload** (file_id, #project_id, #uploaded_by, file_type, file_name, file_path, file_size, uploaded_at).

## 8\. Chapter Conclusion

Sprint 0 produced the complete artefact set required before development begins: a prioritised backlog of 21 user stories, a three-tier architecture with deployment diagram, and a global data model covering all eleven entities. Chapter 4 documents Sprint 1, in which the Django and React scaffolds are built, all models are migrated, and the full authentication and onboarding flow is delivered.

# Chapter 4 - Sprint 1: Foundation and Authentication

## 1\. Introduction

Sprint 1 covers five user stories (US-01 through US-05) with an estimated effort of 16 person-days distributed across a two-week iteration. Its overarching goal is to make authentication, password creation, and user management fully operational - without which no subsequent sprint can proceed, since all API endpoints require an authenticated, role-identified user.

## 2\. Sprint 1 Backlog

Table 15 lists all user stories included in Sprint 1, their module, complexity, and estimated effort in person-days.

## 4\. Conception

### 4.1 Sequence Diagrams

Figure 17 and Figure 18 model the primary dynamic flows implemented in Sprint 1.

#### 4.1.1 Sequence Diagram: Authenticate

The authentication sequence models the full JWT login flow, including the Axios interceptor token-refresh path. The interceptor ensures that access token expiry is transparent to the user in normal operation.

Figure 17: Sequence Diagram - Authenticate

#### 4.1.2 Sequence Diagram: User Onboarding - Create & Activate Account

This sequence captures the full invitation-based user onboarding flow: the Manager creates a user account in the Django Admin panel, which triggers an automatic post-save hook that generates a unique invitation token and dispatches an SMTP email. The invited user then clicks the link to activate their account by setting a password.

Figure 18: Sequence Diagram - User Onboarding

### 4.2 Class Diagram

Figure 19 presents the four domain models introduced in Sprint 1. The User entity is the authentication anchor of the system: Designer and Client extend it via a one-to-one inheritance relationship, keeping role-specific attributes cleanly separated from authentication data.

Figure 19: Sprint 1 Class Diagram

## 5\. Implementation

### 5.1 Data Layer: Custom User Model and Profiles

The user model extends Django's base abstract user class rather than the default user model for three reasons. First, email is used as the login identifier instead of a username, which requires a custom user manager that overrides the default user-creation logic to accept an email address as the login identifier. Second, the role field must be a constrained enumeration with exactly three choices: Manager, Designer, and Client. Third, the account's active status defaults to inactive, preventing uninvited users from signing in before completing the activation flow.

Two profile models, Designer and Client, are linked to the user via a one-to-one relationship. Profile records are created via an automatic signal fired whenever a new user is saved, branching on the assigned role. The InvitationToken model stores a UUID token alongside a foreign key to the associated user, an expiry timestamp set to 48 hours after creation, and a usage flag. Tokens are invalidated on use, preventing replay attacks.

### 5.2 Authentication API Endpoints

JWT authentication is implemented using the Simple JWT library. The access token lifespan was set to 60 minutes; the refresh token to 7 days with rotation enabled. The token payload was extended to include the user's role, so that the React frontend can perform role-based routing without a secondary API call after login.

### 5.3 Invitation Token and Activation Endpoint

The account activation endpoint receives a token string and a new password. It performs three validation checks in sequence: the token record must exist, the token must not have been previously used, and it must not have expired. If all pass, the password is updated, the account is activated, and the token is marked as used.

### 5.4 Permission Classes

Four permission classes enforce role checks: one for each individual role (Manager, Designer, Client) and a combined class permitting both Manager and Designer access. Each verifies that the request originates from an authenticated user and checks their assigned role. These classes are applied at the view level, allowing fine-grained per-action control - for example, creation and deletion are restricted to managers; listing and retrieval are available to any authenticated user.

### 5.5 React Frontend: Login, AuthContext, and ProtectedRoute

The authentication context stores the decoded token data (user ID, email, role) and exposes it to all components via a custom authentication hook. The route guard component wraps role-sensitive pages and redirects unauthenticated or unauthorised users to the login page. The Axios instance includes a request interceptor that attaches the authentication token and a response interceptor that silently refreshes expired tokens and retries failed requests.

## 6\. Interface Realisation

Figure 20-Figure 28 present the Sprint 1 deliverables.

### 6.1 Django Admin Panel & User Management

Figure 20 shows the Django administration panel used by the Manager. Figure 21 illustrates the account creation form, and Figure 22 shows the resulting user management list with role and status visible per entry.

### 6.2 Login Interface

Figure 23 shows the login interface - a centred card with email and password fields. On success, the user is redirected to their role-specific dashboard; invalid credentials display an inline error without revealing account existence.

## Chapter Conclusion

Sprint 1 delivered the complete technical foundation - authentication, onboarding, and all eleven models - on which every subsequent sprint depends. Sprint 2 builds on this to implement project and task management.

# Chapter 5 - Sprint 2: Project and Task Management

## 1\. Introduction

Sprint 2 covers five user stories - US-06 through US-09, plus US-AI-01 - with an estimated total effort of 15 person-days distributed across a two-week iteration. Its overarching goal is to make the application usable for end-to-end project management: a Manager must be able to create a project, assign designers, break it into tasks with estimates, and monitor budget utilisation; a Designer must be able to see the projects they are responsible for.

## 2\. Sprint 2 Backlog

Table 21 lists all user stories included in Sprint 2, their assigned role, complexity, and estimated effort in person-days.

### 3.1 Sprint 2 Use Case Diagram

Figure 32 presents the use cases addressed in Sprint 2. The Manager is the primary actor with create, edit, delete, and assignment capabilities; the Designer participates with a read-only view of assigned projects. The AI Estimator use case is initiated by the Manager and delegates to the Groq API as an external system.

### 4.1 Sequence Diagrams

Figure 33 and Figure 34 model the two primary dynamic flows implemented in Sprint 2. The two diagrams below were selected because they involve either multi-step database writes or an external system.

#### 4.1.1 Sequence Diagram: Manage Projects & Assign Designer

This sequence models the two-step flow by which a Manager creates a project and assigns a Designer. After the form is submitted, the backend performs two sequential database writes - one for the Project record and one for the ProjectAssignment - before returning a single HTTP 201 response. The React frontend invalidates the project list query cache on success, ensuring the new project appears immediately.

Figure 33: Sequence Diagram - Manage Projects

#### 4.1.2 Sequence Diagram: Manage Tasks & AI Estimate Task Hours

The task management feature allows the Manager to decompose each project into tasks and subtasks, each carrying a name, an estimated duration and a status (_To Do_, _In Progress_, _Completed_).

To assist the Manager during task creation, an AI-powered hour estimator is available. On demand, the system queries the project's historical time logs, filters entries with similar task names, and forwards this contextual data to the language model, which returns a suggested duration along with a brief justification.

Figure 34: Sequence Diagram - Manage Tasks

### 4.2 Class Diagram

Figure 35 presents the three domain models introduced in Sprint 2. Project is the structural core, linking the Client profile to all downstream task and assignment records. Task introduces a self-referential parent task link for subtask nesting, and an unplanned flag that will drive the Scope Creep Index in Sprint 5.

Figure 35: Sprint 2 Class Diagram

## 5\. Implementation

### 5.1 Data Layer: Project, Task, and Assignment Models

The Project model configures the foreign key to the client to prevent deletion of any client who owns active projects. Both the budgeted hours and the budgeted monetary amount are stored with decimal precision, enabling the Effective Hourly Rate metric in Sprint 5. The assignment model enforces a compound uniqueness constraint, preventing duplicate assignments at the database level. The Task model introduces two analytically significant fields: an unplanned flag (false by default), which drives the Scope Creep Index, and an optional parent task reference that supports subtask hierarchies without a separate model.

### 5.2 Role-Scoped API ViewSets

The project endpoint applies role-aware query filtering with three branches: managers receive all projects; Designers receive only projects where a ProjectAssignment links the project to their profile; Clients receive only their own projects. Any unrecognised role returns no results. Permission gating separates read from write: project creation and deletion are restricted to managers; updates may be performed by managers or designers; listing and retrieval are available to any authenticated user, with the result set enforcing the data boundary.

### 5.3 Designer Assignment Endpoint

The designer assignment endpoint validates that the target user holds the Designer role, then creates the assignment record. If a duplicate assignment is attempted, if a duplicate assignment is submitted, the database constraint rejects it and the API returns a descriptive validation error. This approach is preferred over a pre-existence check because the database constraint is race-condition-safe.

### 5.4 AI Task Hour Estimator

The AI estimation endpoint is restricted to managers. The backend queries the TimeLog model for up to ten recent logs from the specified project whose task names share keyword overlap with the submitted task name. These records are embedded into a prompt that instructs the Groq API to return a structured response containing the suggested estimate and the model's reasoning. The API key is read from the server's environment configuration. If the API call fails, the view returns HTTP 503; task creation is never blocked by the estimator.

### 5.5 React Frontend

The Manager-facing pages include a CreateProject form (React Hook Form + Zod validation), a ProjectList page with status badges and budget progress bars (TanStack React Query), and a ProjectDetail page with an assignment panel. The task creation side panel includes an Estimate Hours button that calls the AI endpoint and displays the returned suggestion in an advisory card with Accept and Dismiss actions. Tasks flagged as unplanned render with an amber scope-creep badge across all task lists. The designer's home page presents a read-only card list of assigned projects with budget progress and deadline indicators.

## Chapter Conclusion

Sprint 2 delivered the full project and task management layer, with all five user stories completed. Two decisions carry forward to Sprint 5: the unplanned flag on tasks, which drives the Scope Creep Index, and the compound uniqueness constraint on assignments, which prevents duplicates at the database level. Sprint 3 follows with time tracking and deliverable management.

# Chapter 6 - Sprint 3: Time Tracking and Deliverables

## 1\. Introduction

Sprint 3 covers four user stories - US-10 through US-13 - with an estimated total effort of 13 person-days distributed across a two-week iteration. Its overarching goal is to make the application useful to Designers in their day-to-day work: a Designer must be able to log their hours against a task, update that task's status, upload the resulting deliverable file for the client to review, and access any feedback the client has left against the project.

The View Client Feedback flow is a straightforward GET request and is similarly omitted; both are represented fully by their textual use case descriptions above.

#### 4.1.1 Sequence Diagram: Log Time on Task

This sequence models the time logging flow from the Designer's perspective. The Designer submits a form containing the task identifier, hours spent, and a description. The backend validates that the task belongs to a project the Designer is assigned to before persisting the TimeLog record. The React Query cache for the project summary is invalidated on success, causing the budget progress bar to recompute from the updated aggregate.

#### 4.1.2 Sequence Diagram: Upload Deliverable

This sequence models the file upload flow. The frontend encodes the file as a standard multipart upload and posts it to /api/files/ along with the project ID and file type. The backend validates the type-scope rule - Designers may only upload deliverables, not reference materials or brand guidelines - then writes the file to cloud storage (Cloudinary) and creates a FileUpload record in the database containing the metadata. A signed download URL is returned and the file list is updated immediately on the frontend.

### 4.2 Class Diagram

Figure 47 presents the two domain models introduced in Sprint 3: TimeLog and FileUpload. TimeLog is the analytical source of truth for all time-based metrics in the system; it links a Designer to a Task via a foreign key on each side, and stores the logged hours that feed every budget and utilisation computation in Sprint 5. FileUpload links a project to the user who uploaded the file, and carries a file type field that enforces type-scoped access control at the API layer.

## 5\. Implementation

### 5.1 Data Layer: TimeLog and FileUpload Models

The TimeLog model stores hours as a decimal value with two places of precision. The description field is free-text and records what work was performed during the logged period. Both foreign keys are configured such that time logs are automatically removed if the linked task or designer record is deleted. Database indexes on the task-designer combination and the creation timestamp support the aggregate queries used in Sprint 5.

The FileUpload model stores the file path within the cloud storage bucket rather than a binary blob, keeping the relational database lean. The file_size field stores the byte count and is validated against the 50 MB ceiling at the serialiser level before the upload is attempted. The file type field accepts three values: deliverable, reference material, and brand guideline; the API permission layer enforces which roles may upload which types.

### 5.2 Role-Scoped Time Log Endpoints

The time log endpoint applies role-aware filtering. A Manager receives all time logs across all projects. A Designer receives only logs they have authored themselves, filtered to records where the linked designer matches the authenticated user. Any attempt by a Designer to create a log against a task that does not belong to one of their assigned projects is rejected with an access-denied response before the database write occurs. The Manager-facing list endpoint additionally supports project and designer filter parameters for filtered views on the project detail page.

### 5.3 Task Status Update Endpoint

Task status updates are submitted as partial update requests to the task endpoint. The endpoint accepts any subset of writable task fields; for status updates only the status field is sent. Access is restricted to managers and designers; a Designer may only update a task belonging to a project they are assigned to, enforced at the individual record level. The three valid status values - To Do, In Progress, and Completed - are enforced by the serialiser.

### 5.4 File Upload Endpoint

The file upload endpoint accepts a multipart form submission containing the file binary, the project identifier, and the file type. On the backend, the file is uploaded to Cloudinary using the Cloudinary Python library; the returned file URL is stored. The FileUpload record is then persisted linked to the authenticated user who performed the upload. Type-scope enforcement is implemented in the serialiser's validation logic method: Designers may only upload files classified as deliverables; Clients may only upload reference materials or brand guidelines. An incorrect type returns HTTP 400 with a descriptive error message.

### 5.5 React Frontend

The Designer-facing time log form is a slide-out panel accessed from any task row on the project detail page. It contains a task selector pre-populated with the current task, an hours field accepting quarter-hour increments, and a description textarea. On success, TanStack React Query invalidates both the time log list and the project summary queries, causing the budget progress bar to recompute from live data without a page reload.

The task status toggle applies changes immediately with local optimistic updates, reverting on server error. File uploads are validated for type and size before submission. The feedback panel presents items grouped by status with category badges distinguishing revision, approval, and question entries.

## 6\. Interface Realisation

Figure 48-Figure 51 present the Sprint 3 deliverables.

### 6.1 Time Logging Interface (Designer View)

Figure 48 shows a slide-out panel on the project detail page allowing the Designer to submit a time entry against any task. The budget progress bar on the project header updates in real time after each submission.

### 6.2 Task Status Toggle

Figure 49 shows a segmented status control rendered inline on each task row, allowing the Designer or Manager to move a task through Todo, InProgress, and Completed without opening a separate form. Updates are applied optimistically with server confirmation.

### 6.3 File Upload Interface

Figure 50 shows the files uploaded on the project detail page.

## Chapter Conclusion

Sprint 3 made the financial data layer operational, with all four user stories completed and no carry-over. Two decisions have downstream consequences: time log records are from this point the sole source of truth for all budget utilisation and Effective Hourly Rate metrics computed in Sprint 5, and the Cloudinary integration resolves the ephemeral disk risk identified in sprint planning. Sprint 4 delivers the client portal and the full feedback lifecycle.
